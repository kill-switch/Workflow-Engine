to do list ->
-> foo.c and foo.h are database handling , the original code was written by my partner and hence to replace it i have written Foo functions which does the work but dont care of database
they are to be completed

->the server has no way to be closed , i implemented a away to close each componets but lack of time has made me to drop the idea of closing the whole server
